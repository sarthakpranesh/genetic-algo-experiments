# Genetic Algorithm Experiments

This project displays how genetic algorithms can be implemented in real file with the help of intuitive examples such as Flappy Birds, Prey and Predator fish, etc. This project was build using a small custom implementation of Neural Network along with libraries like P5js and Bootstrap.

Genetic algorithms is a vast topic so we won't be able to cover everything, but we aim to still show the power of GAs. Visit us at the link below

## For Developers
Setup is pretty simple and you only need vsCode ( just for it's live server extension )
1. git clone https://github.com/sarthakpranesh/geneticFlappyBird.io.git
2. cd Genetic_Algorithm_Experiments
3. Open the `index.html` file using the live server extension and you are good to go!!!

## Contributors
Please make sure you work on a `forked` version of this repo. All bugs fixes or features implemented need to have a separate branch which should have following naming scheme - `YourName-bug/feature`. After fixing the bug or implementing the feature you can open a `PR` to the master branch of this repo.
