            Genetic Algorithm Learning Experiments

        <p>
            Genetic Algorithm or for short GA is a search based 
            optimization technique based on the principle and concept 
            of Genetic evolution and Natural Selection. In more simple 
            words it's similar to survival of the fittest. Where in a 
            given population only those individuals are selected that 
            are best suited for a particular task.

            This small project was build using a small custom 
            implementation of Neural Network along with P5js and Bootstrap. 
            The same can be replicated using tensorflow.js.

            The main reason behind using custom implementation of 
            Neural Network was that it is more light weight and can be 
            easily tweaked further for a specific problem.

                    This is a popular classic game, where we have 
                    to make sure our little bird friend is able to avoid the 
                    maximum amount of pipes it can. Therefor an ideal bird 
                    would be the one which is able to slowly evolve in a 
                    manner that allows it to avoid those pipes.

                    Prey and Predator Fish

                <p>
                    A classic example for how prey fish adapts and learns to avoid 
                    the predator fish. For this example the prey is the only entity 
                    capable of evolving, to avoid the predator. Whereas the predators 
                    are always focused on the nearest prey. The bacis task for the prey 
                    is to understand in which direction to swim to avoid the predator.
